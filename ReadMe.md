Like the Chimera of Greek mythology (Lion + Goat + Snake), this project is the unholy offspring of three separate Angular apps (Reddit Clone + OMDB Movie Search + G-Tea) which have been combined into one, in order to show a wide variety of front-end capabilities.  The Reddit Clone is a CRUD app, complete with posts, comments, searching, sorting, animations, and more.  The OMDB Movie app populates its search results utilizing the OMDB API.  Lastly, the G-Tea app is a web-store replica, implementing the type of functionality found in a highly flexible shopping cart.
